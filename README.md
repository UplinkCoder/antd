antd
====

antd is a clone of Laby in D

The Original is here _https://github.com/sgimenez/laby_
_Notes_ :
=========
- This program is _NOT_ intended to be a polished game rather it's a testbed for learning algorithms.
- That said, I would be rather pleased if someone could give it a gui for example ...

TODO
====

- GUI 
- better interface for neural-network interaction
- performance tweaks and profiling
Sometime in the Future :
- make it a real game like the original
- make the code real ideomatic D
